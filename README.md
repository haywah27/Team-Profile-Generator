# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information (from a user) about employees on a software engineering team. The user can enter information about three different types of employees: a Manager, Engineer, Intern. Each type of employee are constructors stemmed from a parent constructor to demonstrate extension of classes. After information is entered, a writeFile function using fs generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person on seperate cards. 

Behind the scenes, there is a suite of jest unit tests for each employee function to demonstrate code maintenance.
